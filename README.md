# R-algorithm-for-Historical-Connectivity-Analysis-for-P-ramo-Lineages-using-a-Pleistocene-polen-model

This code is specifically designed for research on páramo ecosystems, aiming to analyze the relationship between historical connectivity and the evolutionary divergence of páramo species, using an ultrametric tree that must be processed with the code from this repository: [insert link]. The required paleoclimatic data must be requested separately. Additionally, the connectivity data used in this code follows a step-by-step workflow in R, which is detailed in other repositories on this profile. For more information on the workflow, visit the following link: [insert link].
